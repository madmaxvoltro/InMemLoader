# InMemLoader

InMemLoader is a tool designed to pull code from a specified website (in this case, localhost), download it into RAM, compile it directly in memory, and execute itâ€”all without writing any files to disk. This project aims to simplify and speed up the process of executing code directly from a remote server or local resources while keeping the operations in memory.

## Features

- Pull code dynamically from a given website (e.g., localhost).
- Compile and execute the code directly in RAM without writing to disk.
- Flexible and lightweight design that works entirely within memory.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/InMemLoader.git
    ```

2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Build the project in Visual Studio using the default configuration (or any custom configuration you prefer).

## Usage

InMemLoader operates entirely within the code. It doesn't require any command-line input once the application is built. The following operations are handled directly by the code:

- The program pulls code from the specified URL (e.g., localhost).
- The code is downloaded into RAM, compiled, and executed directly in memory.

### Visual Studio Setup

1. Open the project in Visual Studio.
2. Set the necessary URL and port (default is `http://localhost`) within the code.
3. Compile and run the project from Visual Studio.

There is no external output generated, as the code is executed entirely in memory.

## Future Updates

- **AES Encryption Support**: Future versions will include AES encryption, enabling secure transmission and storage of code in memory. This will add an additional layer of security to the code execution process.
  
- **Custom URL Handling**: Support for custom URL formats and additional security features such as SSL/TLS support for fetching code from remote servers.

- **Improved Memory Management**: Further optimization of memory usage to handle larger code payloads efficiently.
